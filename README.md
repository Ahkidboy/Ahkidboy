- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ahkidboy

- 👀 I’m interested in **Html**, **Javascript**, **python**, and **AI**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning genetic algorithm
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate on anything

## More about me
I am a 13 year old **child** and I started coding ~2 years ago and although I struggled **ALOT** during my first couple of months with html, I took a break with it and learned python and it was really smooth-sailing. Then I joined the [Replit community](https://replit.com/@JULIODIAZ1) and started html again and I realised it wasnt so hard, I had to start html again because me and my team are making a heavily inspired Among Us game which we call  "[*Betrayal*](https://replit.com/@HackersClan/Betrayal)."  The beta version is about to be announced to the community and I feel like it will get alot of attention, and if it dosent, we will just continue making the 1.0.0 update.

## Work
I am currently working on a [genetic algorithm](https://replit.com/@JULIODIAZ1/Genetic-Algorithm) that learns to say "Hello." and so far... it has 200 lines of code but it is almost finished. A genetic algorithm is an ML algorithm that simulates natural selection you can learn more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP8R0yzAbdo&t=0s) ~~because I cant explain anything~~. I am currently making a function to breed two organisms together multiple times. After im done with my genetic algorithm I will help my team with Betrayal and we will release it and make bug fixes.
